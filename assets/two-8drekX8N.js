Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the initiative aims to analyze medical imaging data, such as CT scans, to identify subtle patterns and biomarkers indicative of early tumor growth that might otherwise go unnoticed by traditional methods. By training AI systems on large datasets of medical images and patient information, researchers are developing AI tools that can assist clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses, leading to earlier intervention and improved survival rates. These AI applications are also being integrated with clinical workflows to provide real-time, data-driven insights, reducing the time to diagnosis and enhancing personalized treatment options for patients. The research highlights the potential of AI to transform lung cancer detection in the UK, making it faster, more precise, and accessible.
