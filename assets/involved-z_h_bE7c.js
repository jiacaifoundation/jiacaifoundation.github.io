While my family and I were not entirely unprepared for this eventuality, it had been many years since we had faced such a profound loss within our close family circle. His passing came far sooner than we had anticipated, and it left an indelible mark on all of us."),e("br"),a(" For those who know me well, you may recall the cherished memories of my grandparents, who played an integral role in my upbringing. From the simple yet essential task of preparing my meals each day to the less glamorous but equally important duty of checking my homework, they were constants in my life. In many ways, I felt closer to them than to my own parents. Their love and care were the foundation of my childhood, and the bond we shared was unshakable."),e("br"),a(" When my grandpa was hospitalized, I was overwhelmed by a deep sense of sadness. Watching him battle an illness that I knew was incurable was one of the most challenging experiences of my life. The pain of seeing someone so dear to me suffer was immense, and coming to terms with the reality of his condition was an emotional journey that tested my resilience."),e("br"),a(" In the wake of his passing, I felt a strong sense of purpose. I wanted to honor his memory in a way that would make a lasting impact. It was this desire that led me to establish the Jiacai Foundation, alongside a group of dedicated trustees. Our mission is clear: to support those who are suffering from NSCLC or are at risk of developing this disease, and to drive meaningful change in the fight against it."),e("br"),a(" The Jiacai Foundation is committed to funding a number of research initiatives aimed at making NSCLC curable within the next 5-8 years. We also strive to promote evidence-based healthy living practices that can help prevent the onset of this disease. Looking back, it's incredible to see how far we've come in the battle against other forms of cancer. Just a decade ago, we were almost helpless against breast or prostate cancer. Today, survival rates for these cancers have soared, thanks to advanced screening techniques that are both accurate and accessible to millions, as well as groundbreaking targeted therapies."),e("br"),a(" NSCLC, however, remains one of the most aggressive and challenging forms of cancer. While progress has been made in developing treatments for those with specific genetic receptors, my grandpa was unfortunately not among the fortunate ones who could benefit from these advancements. This reality has only strengthened our resolve to broaden the scope of innovative genetic medicines and make them available to more people. We aim to extend the lives of those affected by NSCLC and, in doing so, provide hope and relief to millions of families who are at risk of losing someone they love."),e("br"),a(" At the Jiacai Foundation, we believe that every life is precious and that no one should have to face the fear and uncertainty of an incurable disease. We are driven by the hope that, through our efforts and the support of our generous donors, we can create a future where NSCLC is no longer a death sentence. We are committed to honoring my grandpa's memory by making a tangible difference in the lives of others."),e("br"),a(" Thank you for joining us on this journey.
