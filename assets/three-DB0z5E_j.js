The project explores the integration of nanotechnology and biosensing to improve early detection, monitoring, and targeted therapy of NSCLC. Researchers have engineered nanosensors that can detect specific biomarkers associated with the cancerâ€™s progression, providing real-time diagnostic capabilities. These sensors work by binding to molecular markers on the cancer cells, emitting signals that are easily detectable through non-invasive techniques. This approach not only enhances the sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection but also offers potential for personalized treatments by identifying precise therapeutic targets. The research aims to revolutionize NSCLC management by enabling more effective, timely, and less invasive interventions.
