CAR-T therapy involves engineering a patientâ€™s own T-cells to target and destroy cancer cells, while PD-1 inhibitors work by blocking the PD-1 protein on T-cells, allowing the immune system to better recognize and attack cancer cells. The Oxford experiment stands out for its novel approach to combining these two treatments, aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes by targeting cancer in a more comprehensive way. This groundbreaking research has the potential to significantly improve patient survival rates and reduce relapse. JCF is proud to support such pioneering work, offering grants to researchers exploring innovative cancer therapies, including this Oxford-led initiative, to accelerate their efforts and bring transformative treatments to patients worldwide.
